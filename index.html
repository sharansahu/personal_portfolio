        <p>Hello! I am Sharan Sahu, but I go by Sunny. I am a first-year student
           at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science, Statistics, and
           Data Science. I am particularly interested in the fields of
           algorithms and optimization, machine learning, computer vision, and
           quantum computing. My programming knowledge extends to Java, Python,
           and C++ with experience in web development using HTML and CSS.
           In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing basketball, eating food, and traveling.
           I am currently looking for internship/research opportunities, so please
           feel free to connect with me! <a style = "font-weight: bold" href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vrep3IdMhU2r_n9pad_J7kzwkXp3iNmZ/view?usp=sharing" class="cta">Here is my resume</a>

          <h1>Direct Image Matching With Template Matching Via OpenCV</h1>
          <p>
            Given an image, one may want to identify an embedded image within the given image.
            This requires the use of an isomorphic transformation of the projective space from one image to the other.
            In this research, OpenCV, ORB Descriptors, FLANN, Homography/Affine Transformation along with template matching methods
            were used to do direct image matching via feature and keypoint matching for scale-variant images. ORB was utilized instead of
            SIFT in order to keep efficiency and reduce cost. This also included the research of a multi-layer convolutional architecture via DeepMatching.

          <h1>The Detection of Surface Deformities using Machine Learning and Image Processing Methods</h1>
          <p>
            In this research, machine learning methods and image processing will be utilized in order to determine whether a surface contains a deformity. Through the development of a C++ program to generate surface deformities given image length, width, maximum deformity radius, and sample size as the training-set, we utilize machine learning classifiers, namely Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVC), and K-Means Clustering (KMC) to classify surfaces with either no impact, low impact, medium impact, or high impact. This research can be directly applied to the defense industry in helping to determine the weak spots on vehicles, which may not survive enemy fire. Additionally, it can be used in the aviation industry in helping to detect air frame damage, which will aid in the determination of the flight-worthiness of aircraft and help maximize fuel usage. In turn, this platform can be utilized to speed up the process of identifying deformities, resulting in time and cost savings.

          <h1>Formulation for Nested Multi-Cabin Spill and Recapture of Airline Passengers Using True Cabin Demand and Upgrade Demand</h1>
          <p>
            Most research on aircraft sizing considers customer spill based on cabin capacity but in a stochastic process, both demand spill and excess cabin capacity can occur simultaneously. In this research, I have derived a formulation for a nested multi-cabin spill and recapture of airline passengers considering both true cabin demand and upgrade demand. The formulation considers various continuous probability distributions (i.e. normal, logistic, log-normal, and gamma) as the traditional use of normal distribution for the customer demand does not necessarily always work well for businesses and first class cabins. During this process, I have also developed an algorithm to identify best fit (using chi-square goodness of fit) unconstrained demand distribution using observed demand data.
